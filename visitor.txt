The visitor pattern is a way to separate algorithms from data. The algorithm class (the visitor) knows what it wants to do with the data.
The data class (the visitable) knows how to traverse the data. Neither needs to know what the other is doing. If we wish to add another 
algorithm we need not change any of the data classes. If we wish to add another datatype we need not change the algorithm classes.

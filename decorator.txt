The decorator pattern takes an object and creates and new, decorated object from the old with added features.
In this implementation a pointer to the old object is a member of the new object and is initialized when the 
new object is constructed. The old object is deleted using that member pointer when the new object is deleted.
If we wish to keep the original object when the new, decorated object is deleted then we simply remove the
deletion of the base object from the destructor of the decorator class.
